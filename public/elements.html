            Cryptex 2020 will be a two day-long event, and will start at
            10:30AM on 24th January 2020 and end on 26 January,11:59 PM.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cryptex is an individual event. It is expected that users do not collaborate between themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first two users to finish Cryptex shall win prizes. In
            the event that at least two people do not finish the treasure hunt,
            prizes will be awarded to the persons who have made the most progress
            on the leaderboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            The questions, answers or any discussion related to them must not be
            posted anywhere. Doing so will result in immediate disqualification. We shall provide a platform to communicate with the moderators and ask for hints.However, hints shall only be provided at the discretion of the moderators.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a question involves typing answers in an answer box, the answers
            should be typed completely in lowercase, without any spaces,
            punctuation, special characters. Numerals are allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each user’s progress will be monitored through an online
            leaderboard. After each level, the teams are required to type in the
            answer or something related to it to update their position on the
            leaderboard. Every level will have a submission format for the
            portal. Make sure your answers adhere to the submission format.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it isn’t obvious already, access to the Internet and a device to
            connect with are important prerequisites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any attempt to access levels you have not yet reached or any form of
            attack on the servers will result in immediate disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborating with another user is strictly prohibited and may lead
            to the disqualification of both the users involved. Allegations related
            to dogging another team will also be looked into very seriously and
            can have serious consequences.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organizer’s decision is final in any case.
          </li>
          <li>
            The event can be cancelled in the case of insufficient
            participation.
          </li>

				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
					<p>What we think you should do</p>
			</header>
			<hr />
			<ol>
          <li>
            Google is your friend. Usually. You’re expected to use Google and
            other online tools in your quest to crack the questions. Do keep in
            mind that Google may give you erroneous results in certain cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            The questions are open-ended, may have red herrings, cheeky hints
            and may lead you on wild goose chases. If you are getting nowhere
            with a certain approach, do consider that you might be on the wrong
            train of thought.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the other hand, it could be that the answer is ‘colour’ when you
            have been trying ‘color’. Check for alternate spelling, names and
            other such variations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clues might be hidden (especially in the first few questions) to
            reduce wrong trains of attack. Their absence, however, does not
            indicate anything.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hints to the questions will be released on the group based on
            certain factors. The hints and even the titles of the question may
            not have any apparent meaning until you figure of the answer and/or
            receive another part of the clue.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Group is the quickest way to reach the moderators of the
            Treasure Hunt. You may ask for hints on the forum.
          </li>
          <li>
            The questions might involve literary references, simple
            cryptography, wordplay, steganography, conventional puzzles or maybe
            simple connect questions.
          </li>
