# A notice to developers

Due to CRA's limitations, the errors/warnings you see during development (`npm run start`), may not always be the full set of errors.
It is advised to run `npm run lint` to check for errors with the full set of linting rules.
Pre-commit hooks will always check linting with the linting extensions.

## Also, please read the [create-react-app](CRA.md) introduction
